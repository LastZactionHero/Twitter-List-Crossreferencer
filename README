Twitter User List Crossreferencer

This script finds similar Twitter users by crossreferencing Twitter lists. Given a user, the tool downloads every list that contains the user, and identifies any other users on 2+ of these lists.

**Twitter Rate Limit Warning**
Twitter throttles requests to 150 an hour. For popular users on lots of lists, you may only be able to run this tool one time per hour.

Usage:
ruby twitter_list_crossreferencer.rb <SCREEN_NAME>


This example finds similar users to the music blog @pitchforkmedia:
